This is an updated version 2.0.
Here few things I have updated including all the required libraries.
You might see some differences such as,
=> In implementing react-router
=> I have removed react-particles-js since it has been deprecated and used 
react-tsparticles instead, you can see it's implementation in ParticlesComponent.js file.
=> In the index.js file we are no longer using ReactDOM since we can use createRoot 
in React 18.
